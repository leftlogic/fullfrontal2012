- Standard font's are not always being anti-aliased


# Ignore

- sponsor logos too small, being scaled up and showing jaggies at largest "mobile" layout.
- Sold out button incorrectly positioned
- Overlay on speakers shows by default (without hover) and background is solid black so pictures don't show through
- semi-transparent overlay does not appear behind pullout
- bios not accessible - hover only
- "HTML5, beyond markup" heading overflows too much - It starts to happen between 961
  and get worse till 1061 when it's layout changes. Same thing between 640 and 771 - http://i.imgur.com/1LV84.png
